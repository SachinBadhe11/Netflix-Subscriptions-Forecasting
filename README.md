# Netflix-Subscriptions-Forecasting

This project leverages an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast Netflix's quarterly subscriptions. The analysis and forecasting are implemented within a Google Colab environment, promoting accessibility and reproducibility.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict future Netflix subscription numbers by employing a statistical time series model. The workflow comprises the following key stages:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   - The project begins by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and time series modeling.
   - Netflix subscription data is loaded from a CSV file named `Netflix-Subscriptions.csv`.
   - The 'Time Period' column is converted to datetime objects for chronological analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - The historical subscription trend is visualized using a line graph, providing an initial understanding of the data's behavior.
   - Quarterly and yearly growth rates are calculated and depicted using bar graphs, highlighting periods of significant change.

3. **Time Series Modeling with ARIMA:**
   - A time series object is created from the subscription data.
   - The time series is differenced to achieve stationarity, a crucial assumption for ARIMA models.
   - Autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) functions are plotted to determine the appropriate ARIMA model parameters (p, d, q).

4. **Model Fitting and Evaluation:**
   - An ARIMA model is fitted to the time series data using the selected parameters.
   - The model's summary is displayed, providing insights into its statistical significance and overall fit.

5. **Forecasting Future Subscriptions:**
   - The fitted ARIMA model is used to predict future subscription values for a specified number of steps.
   - Predictions are converted to integers to represent discrete subscription counts.

6. **Visualization of Forecast Results:**
   - A DataFrame is created to combine the original data and the forecasted values.
   - A line graph is generated to visualize the historical trend alongside the predicted subscription numbers, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the forecast.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open in Google Colab:** Access the `Netflix_Subscriptions_Forecasting.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. **Data Upload:** Upload the `Netflix-Subscriptions.csv` file to your Colab environment to ensure the notebook can access the data.
3. **Sequential Execution:** Run the code cells within the notebook in sequential order to perform the analysis and generate the forecast.
4. **Result Interpretation:** Analyze the visualizations and the forecasted subscription values to gain insights into Netflix's potential future growth.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3:** The project requires Python 3 for execution.
- **Libraries:** The following Python libraries are essential for the project's functionality:
    - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
    - `numpy`: Numerical computing
    - `matplotlib`: Static plotting
    - `plotly`: Interactive visualizations
    - `statsmodels`: Statistical modeling, including ARIMA

**Installation:** Install the required libraries using the following command in a Colab cell:
bash !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly statsmodels
